## üìå Problem Statement

Predicting the outcome of football matches is inherently difficult due to the unpredictable nature of the game and the many variables that can influence results. This poses a challenge, especially as bookmakers set odds strategically to maximize their own advantage.

To address this, we aim to apply machine learning techniques to analyze historical match data and uncover patterns or variables that may influence outcomes. By doing so, we hope to:

- Better understand the factors that affect match results  
- Improve prediction accuracy  
- Help individuals make more informed decisions when interpreting betting odds

## üß† Project Annotation

We aim to explore how various factors influence the outcome of football matches, such as:

- Betting odds  
- Previous rankings  
- Recent performance

The challenge lies in uncovering whether consistent patterns exist that can help predict match results more accurately.

Our solution involves building a **data-driven model** using historical match data and betting information to identify key predictors of match outcomes. This could benefit:

- Sports analysts  
- Betting companies  
- Fans  

by providing insights into game trends and improving forecasting accuracy.

## üéØ Context and Purpose

Predicting football match outcomes is complex, influenced by variables such as:

- Team form  
- Home advantage  
- Bookmaker odds

With the increasing availability of sports and betting data, this project applies **Business Intelligence (BI)** techniques to discover meaningful patterns and relationships.

### Purpose:
- Assist decision-making in sports analytics  
- Provide insights into match dynamics  
- Explore how external data (like odds) reflects or predicts actual performance

## ‚ùì Research Questions

1. How do bookmaker odds correlate with actual match outcomes?  
2. Does a higher ranking from the previous season increase the likelihood of winning?  
3. Is there a significant "home advantage" when comparing results over multiple seasons?  
4. Do teams that won their last game have a higher probability of winning their current game?  
5. Can you cluster matches into different types?

## üìä Hypotheses

- **H1**: Teams with lower average betting odds (favorites) are more likely to win.  
- **H2**: A team ranked higher last season has a statistically significant chance of winning.  
- **H3**: Home teams win more often than away teams, on average.  
- **H4**: Teams on a winning streak have a higher chance of winning the next match.
