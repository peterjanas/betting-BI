BI Problem Statement: Predicting Premier League Match Outcomes Using Historical Data

Context
The Premier League is one of the most watched sports leagues globally, with significant attention from fans, analysts, and betting markets. Understanding what influences match outcomes can help football clubs, analysts, and betting services make better-informed decisions.

Purpose
This project aims to analyze historical Premier League data (2015–2019) to identify key factors influencing match results and build a predictive model to estimate the outcome of upcoming matches. The focus is on turning raw match statistics and betting odds into actionable insights and visual analytics.

Research Questions
What historical performance indicators (e.g., team ranking, previous match result) are most predictive of a home team's match outcome?

How accurately can match results be predicted based on odds and prior season rankings?

Is there a measurable correlation between betting odds and actual outcomes?

Can a basic BI dashboard provide useful insights to users (e.g., fans or analysts) even without advanced ML models?

Hypotheses
H1: Teams with higher previous season rankings are significantly more likely to win home matches.

H2: Average betting odds before the match are moderately predictive of the final outcome.

H3: A home team’s result in the last match is a significant short-term performance indicator.
